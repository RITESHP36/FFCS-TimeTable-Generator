This web-based scheduling optimizer solves the complex combinatorial problem of generating clash-free university timetables from hundreds of conflicting course and faculty time slots, specifically tailored for VIT's Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS).

By implementing a powerful permutation algorithm in JavaScript, this tool drastically reduces scheduling time for students. It has successfully served over **2,200 unique users** in the first 2 days, eliminating hours of stressful manual planning and spreadsheet juggling.

## üéØ The Problem & The Solution

### The Challenge
University course registration, especially under a Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCS), is a high-stress period for students. They must manually sift through PDFs and websites to find suitable course slots and faculty, often using spreadsheets to perform trial-and-error to avoid clashes. This process is time-consuming, error-prone, and leads to immense frustration due to the sheer number of possible combinations (a combinatorial explosion).

### The Solution
The **Automated University Timetable Scheduler** transforms this process. It provides a clean, centralized interface where students input their desired courses and faculty preferences. The application's core logic then:
1.  **Parses** all possible faculty-slot combinations for each course.
2.  **Executes a high-speed permutation algorithm** to generate every possible complete timetable.
3.  **Validates** each timetable in real-time to detect and eliminate any with time clashes.
4.  **Presents** all viable, clash-free options to the user in a clear, visual format.

This turns hours of manual work into a few seconds of computation, empowering students to make informed decisions quickly and confidently.
